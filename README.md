# LiveSplit.MegaManX
Mega Man X AutoSplitter component for LiveSplit.
This is a work-in-progress component so beware. Though feel free to help me improving it!

Needed help:
- Making the auto start work. What I want to do is make the timer start when you're on the first option (GAME START) and press start on your controller.
